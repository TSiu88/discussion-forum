## About

**Inspired by sites like Reddit and HackerNews, this web application is a discussion forum that allows users to post news, pictures and other info around a certain topic.** Other users can then upvote or downvote content. The more upvotes an item receives, the higher it's displayed on the list.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to enter content into a form and submit to create a new post.
* As a user, I want my new posts to include a timestamp. And I want to see when other listings were posted, too.
* As a user, I want to upvote posts I particularly enjoy.
* As a user, I want to downvote posts I don't like, or find inappropriate.
* As a user, I'd like posts with the most upvotes to appear higher on the page.
<!-- (We haven't explicitly covered this in our curriculum, but here's a hint: You can complete logic before the return statement of a mapStateToProps() method!) -->
